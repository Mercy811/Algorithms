# Hello World in Java (Mac OS X)
For a Mac running Mac OS X 12 or higher, if fail to follow [this guide](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/)
to install IntelliJ IDEA. Follow the next steps:
- install IntelliJ IDEA Community [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
- There are several methods provided [here]([Standard Libraries](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/)), I used the simplest one, which simply download the individual .java files needed, and put them in the same directory as the programm. For example:
```
curl https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdOut.java --output StdOut.java
```
